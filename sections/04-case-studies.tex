\section{Case studies}

Our aim now is to demonstrate by examples that the MAD framework is useful in organising mathematical knowledge and in generating new insights.

\subsection*{Our notes}

Example: By considering binary operations on Dirichlet series (three different ones) and the analogy with real numbers one arrives at the idea that admitting an Euler product is akin to being positive.

Example: Think about how to arrive at the global Weil/F1/t-analogy, maybe via nomic representations and knowledge of the local setting.
